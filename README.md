. Explore and Document the Folder Structure
After creating the project, familiarize yourself with the folder structure:

app: Contains pages for routing; each file here corresponds to a route in your app.
components: A place to organize reusable components (you can create this folder if it doesn't exist).
public: Holds static assets like images or icons.
styles: Contains CSS files for styling.
package.json: Lists dependencies and scripts.
tsconfig.json (if using TypeScript): Configures TypeScript settings.
